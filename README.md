# Object_Detection

My final project try to compare two or more different model for Obejct Detection. 

# YOLOv8
I am simply using `YOLOv8` models in a python environment with opencv on `Windows`, `Mac` or `Linux` system. It can be imported from the ultralytics module.

YOLOv8 is created by Ultralytics teams in 2023. YOLOv8 models are fast, accurate, and easy to use, making them ideal for various object detection and image segmentation tasks. They can be trained on large datasets and run on diverse hardware platforms, from CPUs to GPUs.

You can get more information and install the model form the [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/examples/tutorial.ipynb)
